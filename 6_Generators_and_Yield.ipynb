In fact, the list is so large that merely creating it would consume all of the system's memory. To work around this, she wants to be able to call **get_primes** with a **start** value and get all the primes larger than **start** (perhaps she's solving Project Euler problem 10).\n",

    "Once we think about this new requirement, it becomes clear that it requires more than a simple change to **get_primes**. Clearly, we can't return a list of all the prime numbers from **start** to infinity (operating on infinite sequences, though, has a wide range of useful applications). The chances of solving this problem using a normal function seem bleak."

Thinking about it, we arrive at the following: **functions only get one chance to return results, and thus must return all results at once.** It seems pointless to make such an obvious statement; \"functions just work that way,\" we think.

Just remember that a **generator** is a special type of **iterator**. To be considered an **iterator, generators** must define a few methods, one of which is **__next__()**. To get the next value from a **generator**, we use the same built-in function as for **iterators: next()**.\n",

It does so by calling **yield** along with the value to be passed back (e.g. **yield 7**). The easiest way to remember what yield does is to think of it as **return** (plus a little magic) for **generator functions.**\n",
